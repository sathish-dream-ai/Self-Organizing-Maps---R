Visualization analysis description about different plots in self organizing maps

Codes plot 

The codes plot shows normalized values of each variable within each node in the form of fan diagrams. The readability of the codes plot is a bit complex in our case as there are many variables.

Counts plot

The counts plot displays the approximate number of observations contained in each node. Usually we seek to have a Counts plot as homogeneous as possible.

Variables influence plot

The Variables influence plot or heatmaps show the normalized values of each variable within each node in the map.
